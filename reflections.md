## Research
- Research whether representing Crit amounts with 256 bits is appropriate, considering Ethereum compatibility and cross-chain interoperability implications.
- Explore better pub/address format for accounts and document how it maps to `AccountId` (see `src/account.rs`).
- Research for best crypto primitives on pub/key gen and source of randomness

## Global Todos
- Check visibility of inner modules components
- check usefullness of derive attributes associated to struct and enum (Default, Hash etc);
